# Overview

This is the solution for https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier 

I copied the boilder plate code from Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-neural-network-sms-text-classifier/blob/master/fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb

I was struggling after having trained the model to get correct predictions because I got type errors. I tried tensors, but in vain. At the end I stuck to pure numpy arrays but when I still got errors I seemly restarted the Kernel....and...magic...it worked...grrr

Before turning crazy I took a look on other solutions like https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z8yU9iImTp7hdxZUYbK2i0jODje8KZ8Y?usp=sharing#scrollTo=J9tD9yACG6M9 or https://letientai.io/freecodecamp/ai/nn/ but none of them worked for me because of the above mentioned type error...at least until I restarted the Kernel...

In total my code is not too much different from theirs as to my understanding the used the same underlying tensorflow tutorial for reference: https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn
